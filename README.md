Chirp is my playground for exploring the world of GTK4-rs while working on a chat application. Currently, it's a practice project with a straightforward and functional UI.

## Current Status

üé® **User Interface (UI):** Chirp features an interface crafted using GTK4-rs. I'm refining it into a chat app that offers a practical and smooth experience, where messages are composed and displayed effortlessly.

üåê **WebSocket Support:** Chirp now contains a WebSocket server created with actix-web the GUI can communicate with, allowing usage of multiple clients with auto-reconnecting.

## What's on the Horizon?

üîß **Refining UI:** Further refining the user interface for a more user-friendly experience.

üõ°Ô∏è **Security:** Enhancing overall security, especially WebSocket communication and authentication.

üîí **Message Encryption:** Implementation of encryption measures to further enhance the privacy and security of messages.

## Project Components

- `gui/`: Contains the UI interface built with GTK4-rs along with all the logic and components to make it run.
- `server/`: Hosts a WebSocket server created with actix-web, facilitating communication with the GUI.

## Exploring the Project

1. Clone this project onto your local machine `git clone https://github.com/TheRustyPickle/Chirp.git`.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies, including the latest GTK4, Libadwaita libraries, and Postgres.
3. Install diesel cli `cargo install diesel_cli`
4. Setup DB and run migrations

```bash
diesel setup
diesel migration run
```

5. Start the server `cargo run --bin chirp-server`
6. Launch the GUI using the command `cargo run --bin chirp-gui`
