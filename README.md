Chirp is my playground for exploring the world of GTK4-rs while working on a chat application. Currently, it's a practice project with a straightforward and functional UI.

## What's in the Mix?

ðŸŽ¨ **User Interface (UI):** Chirp features an interface crafted using GTK4-rs. I'm refining it into a chat app that offers a practical and smooth experience, where messages are composed and displayed effortlessly.

## What's on the Horizon?

I've got some ideas that are brewing:

ðŸ“¨ **Bring It Online:** My plan is to take Chirp beyond its current state and enable online communication. Currently a work-in-progress.

ðŸ”’ **Add Security:** In my pipeline is the implementation of encryption measures. This will guarantee that all conversations stay confidential and secure.

## Current Status

- `gui/`: In this section, I'm actively engaged with GTK4-rs, refining the UI to achieve a polished appearance.
- `server/`: While a work in progress, this section is to facilitate the exchange of messages between users.
